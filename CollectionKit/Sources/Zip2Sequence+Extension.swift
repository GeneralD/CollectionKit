public extension Sequence {
	
	/// Creates a sequence of pairs built out of two underlying sequences.
	///
	/// In the `Zip2Sequence` instance returned by this function, the elements of
	/// the *i*th pair are the *i*th elements of each underlying sequence. The
	/// following example uses the `zip(_:)` function to iterate over an array
	/// of strings and a countable range at the same time:
	///
	///     let words = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]
	///     let numbers = 1...4
	///
	///     for (word, number) in words.zip(numbers) {
	///         print("\(word): \(number)")
	///     }
	///     // Prints "one: 1"
	///     // Prints "two: 2
	///     // Prints "three: 3"
	///     // Prints "four: 4"
	///
	/// If the sequence passed to `zip(_:)` is different length from this sequence,
	/// the resulting sequence is the same length as the shorter sequence. In this
	/// example, the resulting array is the same length as `words`:
	///
	///     let naturalNumbers = 1...Int.max
	///     let zipped = Array(words.zip(naturalNumbers))
	///     // zipped == [("one", 1), ("two", 2), ("three", 3), ("four", 4)]
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - another: The second sequence or collection to zip.
	/// - Returns: A sequence of tuple pairs, where the elements of each pair are
	///   corresponding elements of `sequence1` and `sequence2`.
	func zip<Another: Sequence>(_ another: Another) -> Zip2Sequence<Self, Another> {
